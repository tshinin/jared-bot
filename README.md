# Jared-Bot

An extensible, general-purpose discord bot project with music functionality, social interactions through gifs, and other functions!

Jared is a passion project that is in active development and will receive feature updates to broaden the scope of its commands.

## Easy to Use and Intuitive

Jared is built for people with little to no experience in programming, and is consequently intended to be very easy to use. Here is an example!

### How to Play Music with Jared

1. Join a voice call.

2. Find the youtube link of the song you want to listen to (for the sake of example we will use <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstleyVEVO>).

3. In your preferred channel, type `~play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstleyVEVO`

4. Enjoy~

NOTE: Using `~play` multiple times will put your songs in queue. You can use the commands `~stop` to stop the music entirely or `~skip` to skip to the next song in queue if there is one.

## Adding Jared to Your Server

Thanks for showing interest in Jared! Unfortunately he is currently not deployed on the internet and will not run in a cloned repository due to the .env file not being pushed for security reasons. Stay tuned for when he is deployed as these instructions will be updated accordingly.
