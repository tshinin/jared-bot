# Jared-Bot

An extensible, general-purpose discord bot project with music functionality, social interactions through gifs, and other functions!

Jared is a passion project that is in active development and will receive feature updates to broaden the scope of its commands.

## Easy to Use and Intuitive

Jared is built for people that with little to no experience in programming, and is consequently intended to be very easy to use. Here is an example!

### How to Play Music with Jared

1. Join a voice call.

2. Find the youtube link of the song you want to listen to (for the sake of example we will use <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstleyVEVO>.

3. In your preferred channel, type `~play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstleyVEVO`

4. Enjoy~

NOTE: Using `~play` multiple times will put your songs in queue. You can use the commands `~stop` to stop the music entirely or `~skip` to skip to the next song in queue if there is one.
